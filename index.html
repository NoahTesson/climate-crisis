            <h1>What are Greenhouse Gases?</h1>
            <p>
                Greenhouse gases are gases in Earth's atmosphere that trap heat. They allow sunlight to pass
                through the atmosphere, but prevent the heat that the sunlight brings from leaving the atmosphere.
                The main greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and various synthetic
                chemicals.

            <h2>The Hottest Decade on Record</h2>
            <p>
                Due to rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the 2010s were the
                warmest decade in recorded history. According to NASA, 2020 tied
                with 2016 as the hottest year ever.

            <h2>Arctic Amplification: Warming 4x Faster</h2>
            <p>
                Greenhouse gases drive Arctic amplification, where melting ice
                reduces surface reflectivity, causing more heat absorption. This
                feedback loop accelerates warming and ice loss.

            <h2>Deforestation: A Major Carbon Contributor</h2>
            <p>
                Trees absorb CO2, but when forests are cleared, the stored carbon is
                released into the atmosphere. This worsens the greenhouse effect and reduces natural carbon sinks.

            <h2>Water Vapor: The Overlooked Greenhouse Gas</h2>
            <p>
                While CO2 and methane get most of the attention, water vapor 
                contributes the most to the greenhouse effect. However, it acts as a feedback gas, amplifying warming
                rather than driving it.

            <h2>Fossil Fuels: The Top CO2 Culprit</h2>
            <p>
                The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy and transportation is
                the largest source of human-caused CO2 emissions, significantly
                contributing to global warming.

            <h2>Methane: Small but Mighty</h2>
            <p>
                Though CO2 is more abundant, methane traps 84 times more heat than
                CO2 over 20 years. Livestock, landfills, and oil and gas production
                are major methane sources.
